Visit [discussion on astronomy stack exchange](https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/13488/where-can-i-find-the-positions-of-the-planets-stars-moons-artificial-satellit) to have broader overview of possible sources of space objects data positions.

This layout computes position of space objects using SPK files (SPICE Kernel) that matches closely to JPL HORIZON. Source files are generally available on [NASA Planetary Data System archive](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/spk/).
